# Hangman Game ðŸŽ®

This is a console-based Hangman game built in Python. The game randomly selects a word, and the player guesses letters one at a time to complete the word. The player has 6 lives, and each incorrect guess reduces a life. The game ends when the player either completes the word or loses all their lives.
